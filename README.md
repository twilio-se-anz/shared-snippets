# Shared Snippets
This is a collection of snippets created by Solution Engineers at Twilio ANZ

## How to contribute snippets

Top level folders should or organise in products. For example, flex plugin snippets would sit under `/flex`. Try to keep the snippets to one file and name the snippet descriptively so it's easy to know what problem it solves.

Please comment in your snippet any product documentation which will help understand how it's used. Snippets are not intended to be a complete solution, it is just code example. However, please ensure it is working code.

If the snippet is cross product (eg. studio / functions), add description and link in the [CATALOGUE](/CATALOGUE.md) file 
## Reporting Issues
